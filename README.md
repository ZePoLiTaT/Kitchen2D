# Kitchen2D (Under construction)

This is the code repository associated with the paper [_Active model learning and diverse action sampling for task and motion planning_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00967). The project page is at http://zi-wang.com/kitchen2d/.

The coffee task planned by STRIPStream can be found at coffee_task.py.
The motion premitives are in kitchen_stuff.py. An example of using the primitives is in test_kitchen_stuff.py.

## System Requirement
